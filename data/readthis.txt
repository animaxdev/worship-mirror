ABOUT
This game is a small learning experiment and it's
by no means a complete game. However, if you wish
to turn it into one, you're free to fork it, as
long as you respect the license.

I also happily accept pull requests.


HOW TO PLAY
Use WASD to move, mouse to look around. Left click
to fire. Change weapons with numbers (1, 2, 3).
